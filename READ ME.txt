The ZIP folder contains files for implementing the estimating equations used in "Power and sample size requirements for GEE analyses of 
cluster randomized crossover trials" by Li, Forbes, Turner and Preisser (Statistics in Medicine, 2018). Two simulated data sets are used as illustrative examples.

Continuous and binary outcomes are generated from a marginal mean model with nested exchangeable correlation structures to mimic a cross-sectional
cluster randomized crossover trial. 

List of Files:
1) Make Continuous Data.r = R file for simulating continuous outcome data
2) Make Binary Data.r = R file for simulating binary outcome data
3) simdata_cont.csv = simulated trial data with continuous individual outcomes
4) simdata_bin.csv = simulated trial data with binary individual outcomes
5) contMAEE.r = GEE and MAEE program for clustered continuous outcomes, with (canonical) identity link
6) binMAEE.r = GEE and MAEE program for clustered binary outcomes, with (canonical) logit link
7) Illustration of GEE Analysis.Rmd = R markdown file for illustrating the estimation equation methods using simulated trial data 3) and 4)
8) Illustration of GEE Analysis.pdf = pdf file for illustrating the estimation equation methods using simulated trial data 3) and 4)

NOTES:  1) This program requires you to install the MASS package.
	2) The program demonstrates the computation for a trial with 20 clusters, 65 individuals per cluster-period. 
        3) The simulated trial data are sorted by cluster id, and then by period. The columns of the trial data are (from left to right), 
           outcome (in long format), individual id, cluster id, period id, indicator for period 1, indicator for period 2, indicator for treatment. 
	4) You will need to change path names before running the programs.
